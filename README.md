##  About Me
I am a student passionate about tech and programming, currently building my Python skills and growing my experience through practice and mentorship.

My name is Lethabo, and I am a student actively building my foundation in technology. I recently completed a Python training programme at UNISA, where I developed core programming skills such as writing functions, handling user input, working with loops, and performing basic data processing. I enjoy learning through practice and exploring how code can be used to solve everyday problems.

##  Why I Created This Repository

This project is part of my journey to strengthen my technical skills and build a visible portfolio. Each file represents concepts I have learned and applied independently, and I plan to expand this repository as I grow in my chosen tech pathway.

##  My Current Goals

- Strengthen my Python fundamentals through regular practice  
- Build small but meaningful projects to improve my confidence  
- Learn how to structure code professionally  
- Gain guidance from experienced mentors to understand industry expectations  
- Explore beginner opportunities in the tech field and grow into a more advanced role  

##  Looking Ahead

I am committed to continuous improvement and developing both my technical and soft skills. I am currently applying for the She Code Africa Mentorship Program to receive structured guidance, set clearer goals, and learn from women who have experience in the industry. My aim is to keep building projects, expand my knowledge, and contribute positively to the tech community.
